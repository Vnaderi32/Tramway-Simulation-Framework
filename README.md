MATLAB-based framework for simulating tramway motion, energy consumption, and braking over urban paths using customizable Excel input and adjustable parameters.


README

This repo contains all of the codes implemented for the project, you can use it in two ways:

	1. Run with my input data ( Sample ):
	
	- Open ‘main.m’ file, Run and select ‘ Change folder’
	

	2. Run with you data:

	- Open ‘main.m’ file, Run and select ‘ Change folder’.
	
	- Then insert the requested data in the command window.

	- After that, an excel file will be created named “PathDetails.xlsx”
	
	- Write the data related to the path slope (i) and the curve (rho).

	- Re-run the ‘main.m’, and see the results.
